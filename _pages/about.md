Alo! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website! My name is Joaquin Alvarez Galnares. I was born and raised in Mexico. I have an insatiable curiosity for machine learning. Despite the recent prominent progress in AI, many challenges remain. Why do AI algorithms mess up in certain instances? How can we design uncertainty-aware algorithms in order to make reliable predictions? I'm intrigued to find answers to these kind of questions. I am eager to join a group of researchers exploring these topics. Outside of research, I enjoy walking, art, coffee, and yoga.
