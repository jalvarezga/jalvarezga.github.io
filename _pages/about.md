Alo! Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Joaquin Alvarez Galnares. I was born and raised in Mexico. 
Over the last decade AI has experienced an unprecedented growth. Despite the [AI hype](https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/wide-gap-ais-hype-use-business-rcna127210), many challenges remain. When do AI algorithms mess up? How can we make AI algorithms safer and trustworthy? Is it possible to deploy statistical guarantees on a machine learning algorithm that has low interpretability? I'm intrigued to find answers to these questions. Outside of research, I enjoy coffee and yoga.
