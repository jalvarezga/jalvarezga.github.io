Alo! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website! My name is Joaquin Alvarez Galnares. I was born and raised in Mexico. I have an insatiable curiosity for machine learning. Machine Learning has experienced an unprecedented progress over the last years. However, there are many challenges that must be solved if we seek to use AI algorithms with a positive impact on society. Why do AI algorithms mess up in certain instances? How can we design uncertainty-aware algorithms in order to make reliable predictions? I'm intrigued to find answers to these kind of questions. I seek to understand uncertainty in machine learning. I think that Statistics plays a crucial role in this landscape. Statistics allows us to account for uncertainty in high-stakes settings to assess the reliability of machine learning models and evaluate  whether we should trust their predictions or not for decision-making.

Outside of research, I enjoy walking, art, coffee, kombucha and yoga.
