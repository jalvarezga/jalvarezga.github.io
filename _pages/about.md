Alo! Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Joaquin Alvarez. When looking for inspiration I like to walk. Predict addict, I enjoy doing yoga and doing research about uncertainty quantification. Uncertainty is all we got for granted in life. Every once in a while, we become aware of the uncertainty in our lives. There's usually two possible reactions: anxiety or curiosity. We must choose to be curious and grateful in order to enjoy life. Feel free to reach out! I love getting to know people with authentic ways of thinking and I'm always open for new ideas.

Over the last decade AI has experienced an unprecedented growth. Despite the [AI hype](https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/wide-gap-ais-hype-use-business-rcna127210), many challenges remain. When do AI algorithms mess up? How can we make AI algorithms safer and trustworthy? Is it possible to deploy statistical guarantees on a machine learning algorithm that has low interpretability? I'm intrigued to find answers to these questions.
