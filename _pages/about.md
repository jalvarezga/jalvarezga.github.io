Alo! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website! My name is Joaquin Alvarez Galnares. I was born and raised in Mexico. Machine learning has experienced an unprecedented progress over the last years. However, there are many challenges that must be solved if we seek to use predictive algorithms with a positive impact on society. Why do AI algorithms mess up in certain instances? How can we design uncertainty-aware algorithms in order to make reliable predictions? I'm intrigued to find answers to these kind of questions. I think that uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role in this landscape by allowing us to assess the reliability of AI systems and machine learning algorithms for downstream decision-making tasks.

Outside of research, I enjoy walking, art, coffee, kombucha and yoga.
