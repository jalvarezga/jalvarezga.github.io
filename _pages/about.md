Alo! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website! My name is Joaquin Alvarez Galnares. I was born and raised in Mexico. I have an insatiable curiosity for machine learning. Despite the recent prominent progress in AI, many challenges remain. When do AI algorithms mess up? How can we make AI algorithms safer and trustworthy? How can we deploy statistical guarantees on black box models? I'm intrigued to find answers to these questions. I would be thrilled to connect with a research community who is also driven to collaborate and explore these fascinating questions. Outside of research, I enjoy walking, art, coffee, kombucha and yoga.
