It was an amazing experience to attend to the neuroscience workshop! I've been fascinated to discover connections between how the human brain learns and how machines learn.

I was impressed by the talent and dedication of so many researchers. I was also astonished by the data visualization tools that neuroscientists use to understand complex datasets. People were very kind and there were so many interesting talks. Trieste is an incredible place. I loved the environment of the workshop, and the diversity of the people who were there. Hope I can engage in more experiences like this one.
