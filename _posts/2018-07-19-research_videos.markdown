  <p class="video-caption">Magnitude-based pruning in action. By inducing sparsity we can visualize that the magnitude of the weights in the corners are zeroed faster, capturing the visual attention at the center of the images in the MNIST dataset.</p>

  <p class="video-caption">Confident magnitude-based pruning image segmentation example. For large values of the sparsification ratio the predicted masks with the pruned model (fourth column) deviate substantially from the predicted masks with the dense neural network (third column).</p>

  <p class="video-caption">The video shows the role of two hyper-parameters when calibrating an ensemble that aggregates two image segmentation algorithms. Red is false negative, yellow is false positive. Green is true positive. Uncolored regions are true negatives.</p>
