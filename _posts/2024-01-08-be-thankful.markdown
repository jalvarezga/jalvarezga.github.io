This post is under development.

This is a post about my personal opinion regarding depression. I'm not an expert in the field, but I just like to talk about it as a means to do a  philosophical sketch of ideas. Though they are only personal opinions, some do infact have scientific foundations.</span>

If you are not spending enough time in the streets, you better watch out.

Watching this was an immediate memory trigger to my teenage years in school. I recall all my friends and classmates having fun and not caring about school. But honestly I did care about school. And probably I didn't have the greatest time during those days. The days where you are supposed to be stress-free and enjoying life without limits. The days where you are supposed to experience the world without restrictions and try 'cool' stuff.  But instead of regretting that I didn't relax more during those days, and instead of regretting that I could have had more fun during those days, I choose to honor what I felt during those years. I felt that I wasn't safe in this world. I felt that paying for my education was something that I could not take for granted. I was in survival mode, but wasn't aware at the time. And not feeling safe is one of the hugest triggers you can get to take action and grow beyond your limits regardless of the consequences. So for me it's fine that I haven't done many of the things that one is supposed to experience when you are young. The 'cost' of not having those kind of experiences has had an enormous payoff in my personal growth. I've got to experience the world through a different lens.
