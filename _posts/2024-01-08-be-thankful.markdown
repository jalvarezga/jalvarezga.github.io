This post is under development.

<span style="color: red"> 
This is a post about my personal opinion regarding depression. I'm not an expert in the field, but I just like to talk about it as a means to do a  philosophical sketch of ideas. Though they are only personal opinions, some do in fact have scientific foundations.</span>



To begin, I would like you to consider a revealing fact about depression: [most people on antidepressants donâ€™t need them](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/19/most-people-on-antidepressants-dont-need-them?utm_medium=social-media.content.np&utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=editorial-social&utm_content=discovery.content).


Which motivates a question about how should we treat depression? How should we think about this taboo topic? This is not a matter of whether pills are helpful or not. I would like to explore the idea of depression from a philosophical perspective.

[Depression is tricky](https://time.com/4053881/antidepressant-placebo-effect/). The medical/psychological community hasn't gotten a conclusive unanimous point of view about depression. And there are actually various [mis-conceptions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001865/) about it, even in the scientific community!







I recently read [a book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58818434-the-awakened-brain) from Dr. Lisa Miller, who has had a deep impact on my perspective about life.

Constant reminders I make to myself:

- Don't take things for granted! This is an awesome way to put things into perspective. You can walk, you have water, you can speak and you have eyes to appreciate the beaty in this world. You have a bed to sleep. Don't take those minor things for granted. Some people would give their lives just to have some of those things.

- Do social service: this is a great way to appreciate all the blessings that you have. Sad for not having a girlfriend? Go help adults with physical disabilities who will never have one! And you'll find blessings in that experience. Sad for not getting invited to a party? Go meet people who can't go to a party even f they were invited. You might be surprised to find them happy despite their physical limitations. You may realize how little stuff it takes to be happy. 



- Life is in the streets: if you are not spending enough time in the streets, you better watch out. Go meet people, grab a walk, call your old friends. Be curious about the wonders in the streets.


- Stay thankful! This is perhaps the best tool that you got:  ***gratitude.*** Gratitude is a contemplation of life. Gratitude allows you to see beaty in places you never thought you could find beauty. 

- Move! Exercise is powerful. Exercising is not an option, it's a necessity. The body literally needs to move. We're built for moving.


- Passion: you should get excited about something! It can be anything: art, cooking, yoga, playing sports, taking photos. If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything.


- Take action! Don't wait for life to happen. Make it happen. But at the same time, be patient! There will be hundreds of days where absolutely nothing happens. Stay grateful in those days, and practice patience, because worthy things may not happen overnight. 


- Get comfortable with being uncomfortable: do stuff that makes you grow. You can't grow on your couch watching TV. You can't grow playing video games and scrolling in social media for 6 hours. Get a cold shower, talk to a random person, try new activities.


- Be vulnerable: ask for help! Sometimes we can't handle everything by ourselves. There's always people who find joy in helping. Helping is an innate human desire.
