This post is under development.

This is a post about my personal opinion regarding depression. I'm not an expert in the field, but I just like to talk about it as a means to do a  philosophical sketch of ideas. Though they are only personal opinions, some do in fact have scientific foundations.</span>



To begin, I would like you to consider a revealing fact about depression: [most people on antidepressants donâ€™t need them](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/19/most-people-on-antidepressants-dont-need-them?utm_medium=social-media.content.np&utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=editorial-social&utm_content=discovery.content).


Which motivates a question about how should we treat depression? How should we think about this taboo topic? This is not a matter of whether pills are helpful or not. I would like to explore the idea of depression from a philosophical perspective.

[Depression is tricky](https://time.com/4053881/antidepressant-placebo-effect/). The medical/psychological community hasn't gotten a conclusive unanimous point of view about depression. And there are actually various [mis-conceptions] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001865/) about it, even in the scientific community!







I recently read [a book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58818434-the-awakened-brain)  from Dr. Lisa Miller, which has had a deep impact on my perspective about life.

*Dr. Lisa Miller. She's a pioneer in the study of depression and its links to spirituality.*




Practical ideas I like to keep in mind:

- Life is in the streets: If you are not spending enough time in the streets, you better watch out.
